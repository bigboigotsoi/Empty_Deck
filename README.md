# -Empty-_FlashCards
Flash cards on Python!

It can be confusing adding your own 
questions and answers to the flashcards, so...
    
1.  Use the 'Question Array Creator.py' program 
    to make your own array of questions and answers.
    
2.  Copy your created array into 
    the Flashcards program (at line 31).
    
4.  Run the program, and it'll test you! 

JC.py is a module of handy functions 
I like to use, named after me :)
