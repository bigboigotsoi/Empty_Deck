# Flash-Carder: Flash Cards on Python!
(Standard PC Edition, + Mobile Deck Creator)



First, provide your learning material as a 'Deck Data' file within the 'Your Decks' Folder. You can do this in two ways.

    Easy Way:  Replace the questions and answers in the example 'Deck Data.txt' file with your own, following the default/provided bullet format. 
    
Or:

    Personalized Way:  Customize it/create your own deck data files. 
                       You can rename the Deck data files and/or modify 'questionBullet' and 'answerBullet' in the Flash-Decker to your liking.



IMPORTANT: Use question, answer, etc. bullets as demonstrated with the example data in the Deck Data file, in order for file loading to work correctly.
          
          
          
Then...

    2:  Help the Flash-Carder locate the file.
      
Do this by either...

        - Modifying the default directory/name stored in the 'DeckFile' variable.
        
        - Selecting the file using File Explorer within the Carder program. 
         (ONLY available if 2 or more Deck files are stored in the 'Your Decks' folder.)
          
Then the Flash-Carder reads it, and tests you!
