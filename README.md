# Flash-Carder: Flash Cards on Python!


First, you should provide Deck Data from a 'Deck Data' file, 
held in the 'Your Decks' Folder. You can do this in two ways.

    Easy Way:  Replace the questions and answers in the 
               example 'Deck Data.txt' file with your own. 
    
Or:

    Personalized Way:  Customize it/create your own one.
    
For the more personalized way, you...

    1:  Modify/create your 'Deck Data' text file.

Note:

        - You can rename the Deck data file and/or modify 'questionBullet'  
          and 'answerBullet' in the Flash-Decker to your liking.

        - Use those bullets appropriately as demonstrated with the
          example data in the Deck Data file, in order for loading to work. 
          
Then...

    2:  Help the Flash-Carder locate the file.
      
Do this by either...

        - Modifying the default directory/name stored in the 'DeckFile' variable.
        
        - Selecting the file using the File Explorer. 
          (ONLY available if 2 or more Deck files are stored in the 'Your Decks' folder.)
          
Then the Flash-Carder reads it, and tests you!
