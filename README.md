# Flash-Carder: Flash Cards on Python!
  
First, you should provide Card Data from a 'Card Data' file, 
held in the 'Your Cards' Folder. You can do this in two ways.

    Easy Way:  Replace the questions and answers in the 
               example 'Card Data.txt' file with your own. 
    
Or...

    Personalized Way:  Customize it/create your own one.
    
For the more personalized way...

    1:  Modify/create your 'Card Data' text file.

        Note...
        - You can rename the card data file and/or modify 'questionBullet'  
          and 'answerBullet' in the Flash-Carder to your liking.

        - Use those bullets appropiately as demonstrated with the
          example data in the Card Data file, in order for loading to work. 

    2:  Help the Flash-Carder locate the file.
      
        Do this by either...
        - Modifying the default directory/name stored in the 'cardFile' variable.
        
        - Selecting the file using the File Explorer. 
          (ONLY available if 2 or more card files are stored in the 'Your Cards' folder.)
          
Then the Flash-Carder reads it, and tests you!
 
(JC.py is just a module of handy functions I like to use, named after me.)
