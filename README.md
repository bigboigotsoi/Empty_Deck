# -Empty- FlashCards
Flash Cards on Python!
  
Firstly, duplicate the Beta and all its files.
(To prevent overwriting the original 'Empty' Flashcards Template).

To provide Data/Questions for the FlashCards, you can either...
A.  Let the FlashCards program read it all from your 'Card Data'.
    (and set 'FetchingDataFile' to True)
    
B.  Hard Code in your FlashCard data into the 'AllQuestions' Array. 
    (and set 'FetchingDataFile' to False)

How to do Option B. is explained in the FlashCards Program.

To do Part A...

A.1 Modify your copy of the 'Card Data' file to include your own data:

    Note...
    A.1.1   You can modify 'qustionBullet' and 'answerBullet' to your liking.
    A.1.2   Use them appropiately as demonstrated with the Example Data
            already in the Card Data file, in order for loading to work.
    
A.2 Modify the directory/name stored in the 
    'dataFile' variable to locate your card data file.

A.3 Run the Flashcards program and it should load your data!

JC.py is a module of handy functions I like to use, named after me :)
