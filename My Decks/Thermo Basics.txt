# 1-1 Energy and Laws # 

> Define Energy.
- The ability to cause changes

> Law of Conservation of Energy?
- Energy can transfer into other forms, but the total amount remains constant.

> (System/body) Energy Change equation?
- delta E = E_in - E_out

> First Law of Thermodynamics?
- Energy is a Thermodynamic property.

> Second Law of Thermodynamics?
- Energy has a quality as well as quantity.
- Actual processes act in the direction of decreasing energy quality.

> Newtons First Law?
- If there are no forces on a body
- it will remain at rest / constant velocity

> Newtons Second Law?
- If there are forces on a body, then
- F = ma




# 1-2 Dimensions and Units

> A physical quantity is also know as a ...
- Dimension

> kWh is ...
- The amount of energy used to run a 1kW power device for one hour.

> Dimensional Homogeneity?
- All terms in an equation must have the same unit. 
# to be correct.

> Letters/Symbols with a dot above them mean they are ... 
- rates

> lowercase Letters/Symbols mean the thing is ... 
- specific




# 1-3 Systems and Control Volumes #

> System?
- A region or quantity of matter in space chosen for study.

> Open System?
- Control volume system where mass can cross the boundaries

> Closed System?
- Fixed mass system where mass cannot cross the boundaries

> Isolated System?
- Systems where energy cannot cross the boundaries

> Boundary?
- The (imaginary) control surfaces separating/shared by the system and its surroundings

> Types of boundary?
- Fixed
- Moveable




# 1-4 Properties of steam

> Intensive Properties
- Characteristics independant from the mass of its system.

> Extensive Properties
- Characteristics dependant on the size of its system.

> An extensive property per unit mass is a ... ?
- Specific property

> The reciprocal of specific volume is...
- Density
