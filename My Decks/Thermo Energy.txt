# 1-7 processes

> Process
- Changes in a system from one equilibrium state to another

> Processes pass a series of states as they run. This series is called a  ...
- Path

> How to describe a Process?
- Specify the initial and final states, and the path  between them.

> Quasistatic Process?
- An idealized process which stays infinitesimally close to equilibrium at all times.

> Processes that keep specific volume constant are ...
- Isochoric
- Isometric

> The properties of a steady flow system remain ...
- constant as time passes

> Which properties of a steady flow systems control volume can stay constant
- Mass
- Total Energy
- Specific Volume

> The properties of a steady flow systems can vary with ...
- position within the system.



# Chapter 2. Energy #

> What things are ignored when analysing total energy of a system?
- Electrical energy
- Magnetic Energy
- Surface Tension Energy

> Total energy is mainly the sum of ...
- Internal Energy of all molecules
- Kinetic Energy of the system
- Gravitational Potential of the system

> Total energy per unit mass, 'e' equation?
- e = u + v^2/2 + gz

> In Stationary systems, which energies remain constant? (+ then total energy =)
- Kinetic energy
- Potential Energy
-  Internal Energy

> the total energy of a stationary system is found from the m... (+ symbol)
- Mass flow rate

> Mass flow rate is proportional to ? (+ both equations)
- Volume flow rate
- m^. = pV^.
- m^. = pA_cV_avg

> what does V_avg represent in m^. = pA_cV_avg ?
- Average fluid flow velocity 

> Energy flow rate from a stationary system, E^. = m^. * ? (symbol + worded)
- Specific energy
- e

> How can energy cross a boundary?
- by heat 
- by work

> Heat definition?
- Energy transfered between systems by virtue of temperature difference

> adiabatic means ...
- No heat transfer to surroundings

> Difference betweeen adiabatic and isothermal processes?
- Adiabatic systems can still have their temperature changed by non heat ways like work.

> How can Power be represented as rate of work? (symbol)
- W^.

> System properties such as total energy only chanage if ...
- The systems state changes

> Change in system energy = ?
- m(u_2 - u_2) + m/2(V_2^2 - V_1^2) + mg(z_2 - z_1)

> Energy can be transferred to/from a system via...
- Work
- Heat
- Mass
